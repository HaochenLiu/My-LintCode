130. Heapify

Given an integer array, heapify it into a min-heap array.
For a heap array A, A[0] is the root of heap, and for each A[i], A[i * 2 + 1] is the left child of A[i] and A[i * 2 + 2] is the right child of A[i].
Have you met this question in a real interview?
Example
Given [3,2,1,4,5], return [1,2,3,4,5] or any legal heap array.
Challenge
O(n) time complexity
Clarification
What is heap?
Heap is a data structure, which usually have three methods: push, pop and top. where "push" add a new element the heap, "pop" delete the minimum/maximum element in the heap, "top" return the minimum/maximum element.

What is heapify?
Convert an unordered integer array into a heap array. If it is min-heap, for each element A[i], we will get A[i * 2 + 1] >= A[i] and A[i * 2 + 2] >= A[i].

What if there is a lot of solutions?
Return any of them.
