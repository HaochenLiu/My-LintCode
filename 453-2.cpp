/*
453. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Flatten a binary tree to a fake "linked list" in pre-order traversal.

Here we use the right pointer in TreeNode as the next pointer in ListNode.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
              1
               \
     1          2
    / \          \
   2   5    =>    3
  / \   \          \
 3   4   6          4
                     \
                      5
                       \
                        6
Note
Don't forget to mark the left child of each node to null. Or you will get Time Limit Exceeded or Memory Limit Exceeded.

Challenge
Do it in-place without any extra memory.
