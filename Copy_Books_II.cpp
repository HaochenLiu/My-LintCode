Copy Books II

Given n books( the page number of each book is the same) and an array of integer with size k means k people to copy the book and the i th integer is the time i th person to copy one book). You must distribute the continuous id books to one people to copy. (You can give book A[1],A[2] to one people, but you cannot give book A[1], A[3] to one people, because book A[1] and A[3] is not continuous.) Return the number of smallest minutes need to copy all the books.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given n = 4, array A = [3,2,4], .

Return 4( First person spends 3 minutes to copy book 1, Second person spends 4 minutes to copy book 2 and 3, Third person spends 4 minutes to copy book 4. )
